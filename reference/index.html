          Khan Academy's Intro to JS:
        </a>
        This is an excellent place for beginners to start. The interactive lessons will take you through some very important programming concepts. Everything is visually based, so you can see what your code is doing. There is excellent feedback, so you never get stuck.

          The p5.js website:
        </a>
        P5.js is a JavaScript library designed "to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners." It is the backbone of the creations we make in MARTH Club. There is a ton of great info on this site, including blocks of working code that you can copy and paste into your projects. Especially check out the <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">reference</a> pages.
