<h3>TUTORIALS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>GETTING STARTED: Do this first!</li>
<ul>
<li>Create a GitHub account: You'll make your online portfolio,
where you build and share your creations. Be sure to register
your GitHub username with MARTH Club by filling out this short
form (bwls.net users only).<br>
</li>
<li>Create your first project: You'll learn how to copy a
project from another GitHub user. You'll import a blank
"sketch" from the marthClub GitHub page. It won't do much, but
we'll fix that shortly...</li>
<li>Build your first project: You'll write some actual code that
actually does something. And it will live on your GitHub page
where you can share it with the world!</li>
<li>Make it your own: You'll learn about a few basic commands
that you can use to tweak your project and make it your own
unique work of art.<br>
</li>
