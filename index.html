    Welcome to the BWHS MARTH Club website!    <b>MATH + ART = MARTH</b><br>
    <br>
    MARTH Club is a community of artists and learners who create art using
    code. We believe in the following principles:
    <ul>
      <li>communitySupport: We learn together. We create together. We help
      each other to learn and create.</li>
      <li>newKidLove: We all start as beginners, and we never forget
      that. We strive to help others to grow by sharing our
      knowledge freely.</li>
      <li>noCodeSnobs: When someone asks for help, we meet them at
      their level. We understand that everyone learns differently
      and that we are all at different levels of coding expertise.</li>
      <li>openSource: We share our creations openly so that others
      might learn from our work and build upon it.<br>
    </ul>
    <br>
